# Create Node REST API

A helpful npm package that generates a default Node.js + Express.js RESTful API template.

## Installation

This package requires that you have both Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't already have Node.js, you can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Verify you have both running by running `node -v` and `npm -v`. You should get a version number for each if they are installed correctly.

Make sure you have `npm` installed globally with the command

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

With both of those packages installed, now you can run

```
npm i -g create-node-rest-api
```

## Usage

With **create-node-rest-api** installed, you can now run the command from the command line to generate a new directory name for your REST API server using `create-node-rest-api <your-project-name>`.

Once the script finishes running, you can `cd` into the project and begin working. You can also test the server immediately using the command `nodemon` directly from within the root of the project directory.
